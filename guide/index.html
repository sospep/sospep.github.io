These are things like lucid dreaming, artificial intelligence, utopian movements, and Esperanto. I'm mostly fine with boring the normals and living in the Vibrant True World of Beauty with its other full-on dork denizens. One of the things that holds my kinsmen together, though, is an unfortunate thing: they are all asses. They decimate the chances of their ideas' success by offending everyone they meet, making it look like being happy and having friends are suspicious, counterrevolutionary behaviors. I would propose that sacrificing some smaller truths in your day-to-day interactions is the only way for the greater truth to prevail</li>

As an engineer, you may be more interested in getting on with your job than compensation. However, if you&rsquo;re working at a fast growing startup, with a little luck and the right planning you can walk away from a liquidity event with a significant amount of money.

Whether or not Java has stayed true to its mission or not is an open question, but it certainly tries not to let current fashions sway it too far off course. Java has been used to write code for anything from smart-cards, through embedded devices, and all the way to mainframes. It is even being used to write mission- and safety-critical hard realtime software.</li>

These trends aren&rsquo;t completely arbitrary, and they are consistent with one another. The birth of a very large number of small, young, fast-moving startups, has given rise to a preference of lean development approaches. Those require easier onboarding, fewer installation, deployment and configuration steps, and a convergence of the roles of development and operations.</li>

By that measure, I&rsquo;d argue that it&rsquo;s also the most misunderstood version control system in the world. This statement probably doesn&rsquo;t ring true straight away because on the surface, Git is pretty simple. It&rsquo;s really easy to pick up if you&rsquo;ve come from another VCS like Subversion or Mercurial. It&rsquo;s even relatively easy to pick up if you&rsquo;ve never used a VCS before. Everybody understands adding, committing, pushing and pulling; but this is about as far as Git&rsquo;s simplicity goes.
