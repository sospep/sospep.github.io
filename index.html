			<p>I love a good guide! When I don't have a clue on HOW TO do something with {_insert_subject_}, you can open up a "good guide" and you can get started quickly with detailed step by step instructions, enough explanation to give you a bit of understanding, but not drown you in theory and of course, pointers to the resources that you need to dig deeper into the well of subject knowledge, should you choose to do so. </p>

			<p> <a href="guide.html"> guide *.*</a> is a compiled, curated listing of some of the best guides that I have come across on a number of different (mostly tech oriented) topics. I have organized each of the guides into a subject CATEGORY to help you to quickly explore the areas that interest you the most. </p>

			<a id="learn-git-by-doing" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>guide git.* - git started - learning git by doing</h3>

			<p> 
				I avoided git for as long as I possibly could, but the time to put on my big boy britches and tame this beast has come. Starting with the absolute basics that you need to get started with git and working my way up and into the intermediate complexities of git ... 
			</p>

			<p>
				<a href="http://sospep.com/view/tasks?id=326">guide git.*</a> - this is my journey into attempting to master the world of git by starting with building a simple project and then progressing from there. Along the way I will show you how easy it is to create your own guides as you master your own demons and even how to to use existing guides to jump start the creation of your own versions.

				If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.
